        About Tartendown
        </h1>
        <p>
Dawn has a long rooted history with Tartendown. From the young age of 13 she worked at the nurseries on Saturdays and in her holidays. She enjoyed the surroundings and experience so much that 10 years later she took over the business when the previous owners retired. With huge amounts of work, enthusiasm and determination Dawn and Simon built the new nurseries from scratch next to the original site</p>
